The year is 2017 and I come across an ad about coding bootcamps and how they can lead to a rewarding career. 
My interest grew when I realized that I could create things/programs from the ground up. I've had ideas about new technology prior to my more mature interest of software development but they were merely ideas. I know that in life when you want to get things done one must take initiative. The development aspect lines up with my current profession of construction minus the physical abuse that the body has to endure. I have a degree in Social Sciences with an interest in Psychology so I plan on using the tools acquired along my journey to influence fields including but not limited to psychology, music and fitness.
