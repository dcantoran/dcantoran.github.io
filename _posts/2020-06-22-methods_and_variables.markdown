A variable is a definition made up of characters that can store information. You can define what you want a variable to be named as long as it's aptly named by conventional standards and that it doesn't begin with a number, be a reserved word or have punctuation nor spaced characters. Variables should begin with a lowercase letter. Once a variable is assigned a value type (string, integer, etc.) the variable then becomes that value type. Place an equal sign after the variable name in order to assign it a value.

A method is a defined function that contains logic and that can perform various tasks. To create a method in Ruby you start by writing 'def' followed by the method name. A good practice for method naming is to make sure that the ascribed name is related to the task the method will perform.
