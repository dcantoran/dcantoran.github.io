Upon initial assignment of this first project I had some doubts on my ability to complete it so I returned to the beginning of the curriculum trying to fill in any gaps in my understanding. It's taken me a long time to finally complete this but once complete it feels reaffirming. Having a good understanding of how a CLI is supposed to run is recommended. Learn has the necessary tools to help you understand what a CLI is so don't overlook them. However, objects and their relationships are really what this project is about. The curriculum has everything necessary on objects but the videos added for reference are beneficial. The scraping is a matter of connecting the dots and at times you'll need high accuracy in order to scrape specific data but luckily every tool you need is included in the learn curriculum. Google is also a great resource when stuck. Testing is key once you think you're finally finished. Run your app several times even if you think it doesn't need any more tweaking. You might find a few details that need adjustment. Don't get discouraged and keep on pushing forward.
